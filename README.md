Semester Grade Calculator Project
This Project is designed to give a user a system to calculate their GPA. The emphasis is on the 
system itself and the user interaction. The user will be able to create their own account and login, 
they will be able to add the name of their classes, the grade they earned, and the weight of the 
course. They will then be able to check their GPA from the courses that they have entered. The 
user will also be able to modify any of the information that they have entered. They will be able 
to change the name of any course they are taking, and the grade that they previously entered, or 
the credit of the course. This project is something I will continue to develop as I would like to 
take full advantage of it while at Clarkson. Further development that I will be implementing will 
be allowing users to input individual items for a specific course like a homework assignment and 
the weight of that assignment to determine the overall grade for one course and thus GPA for all 
courses. Below are a set of instructions for the use of the program, they are supplemented with
the PowerPoint if that is an easier visual:
- The User will first be prompted and asked if the user has logged in before
- I have provided a generic account for first use: 
o Username: CuStudent
o Password: CU2022
(case sensitive)
- First lets take a look at the list of courses that the user is taking by pressing 3
- As we can see the user is taking Chemistry, a Math course, and CS141
- A user who planned on taking several math courses over the years may not care the 
course is simply called Math, but I want to change it to Calculus.
- The user has been prompted to enter what class to modify, start by entering Math (case 
sensitive)
- After that enter 1 to change the class name and enter Calculus, it then returns the updated 
course list to the user. 
- After that lets take a look at the grades for our Chemistry course, start by entering 3 to 
modify a course
- Then enter Chemistry (case sensitive), then enter 2 after prompted to change the grade
- The user is told what the current grade is and asked what to change it to, the file is then 
updated
- Seeing how that functions you can do the same thing with the credit of a course by going 
into the “modify classes” portion of the system
- Entering 2 will take the grades entered and calculate the GPA using the weight of the 
courses provided
- You can terminate the code by pressing 4 on the post login screen and create your own 
login and do any of the above with your own courses!
